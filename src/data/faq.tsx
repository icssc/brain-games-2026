        Brain Games events are designed for teams of 2-4 people (we recommend
        4). If you already know your team, indicate it on the sign-up form. If
        you don&apos;t have a team yet, don&apos;t worry! Just mark that when
        you sign up, and we&apos;ll match you with one.

    question: "Do I have to sign up ahead of time?",
    answer: (
      <p>
        Due to capacity limitations, all teams must register ahead of time. Our
        capacity is limited to 25 teams, and teams will be given spots on a
        first-come, first-serve basis. Any teams that register after that will
        be put on a waitlist, and we&apos;ll contact your team by email if a
        spot opens up.
